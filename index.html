<h3> History: </h3> 
<p> DHP was founded by Joe Smith in 1965. It first sold basic needs for pets, such as pet food, toys, cages, etc. When the company discovered how popular pets were, they brought in small pets (such as hamsters, birds, and fish). Their main customers derived from the University of New Hampshire, especially from students who came far from home seeking a furry companion. Our company today still sells some of the top rated pet supplies in the area, and works closely with animal shelters and breeders for animals such as cats and dogs. </p>
<h3> Why Use Us? </h3>
<p> Pets are just as important to us as they are to our customers. At Durham House of Pets, we make it our priority to treat each and every customer above and beyond. We work with local distributors who focus on small companies like our own in delivering the best results. We have a 100% satisfaction guarantee or money back policy. We work with local animal shelters as well, and donate 10% of our profits to shelters and other foundations working to help animals in need. </p>
